Normal to Surface constraint

The normal to surface constraint is an addon for Blender that calculates the normal vector to a mesh and applies it to the object.
This tool simulates the blender UI to change the target, change the track and up axis, toggle enable/disable and control the influence of the constraint.
Documentation is in progress.
Please, read the ToDo.txt to find the limitations and the improvement in WIP.
