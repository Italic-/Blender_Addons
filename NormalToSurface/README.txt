Normal to Surface constraint

The normal to surface constraint is an addon for Blender that calculates the normal vector to a mesh and applies it to the object.
This tool simulates the blender UI to change the target, change the track and up axis, toggle enable/disable and control the influence of the constraint.

Installation is standard like any other Blender addon.
To add/remove the constraint, go to the “Relations” tab > “Create Normal To Surface constraint”
The constraint can be changed in the UI panel > “Custom Constraints”
